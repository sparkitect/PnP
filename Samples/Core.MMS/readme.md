# GENERAL COMMENTS #
Developing customizations with CSOM is very similar to developing .NET server taxonomy solutions: get a reference to the TaxonomySession object and the TermStore object, Group objects, TermSet objects, and Term objects required for the session. When executing this sample, ensure that the account has the appropriate permissions to create new term set groups and terms.
